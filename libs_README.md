# Optional Libraries

Place these files here to enable additional features:

## xlsx.full.min.js (Required for Excel import/export)
Download from: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/xlsx/dist/xlsx.full.min.js
Size: ~1.5MB

## qrcode.min.js (Optional — for QR code display)
Download from: https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/qrcodejs/1.0.0/qrcode.min.js
Size: ~20KB

Without these files:
- Excel import/export: disabled (warning shown in UI)
- QR codes: falls back to text display (still scannable in some apps)

The app is fully functional for all other features without these libraries.
